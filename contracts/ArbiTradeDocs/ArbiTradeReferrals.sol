//In this example, the REFERRAL_REWARD_PERCENTAGE variable is set to 5%, meaning that referrers will receive 5% of the transaction fee for every user they refer to the platform.

//Modify the buy function in your token contract to include a referral reward. You can do this by adding a conditional statement that checks if the user has been referred by another user. If they have, you can calculate the referral reward as a percentage of the transaction fee, and transfer the reward to the referrer's account.

//The REFERRAL_REWARD_PERCENTAGE variable would represent the percentage of the transaction fee that is paid out as a referral reward.

//Create a function to allow users to refer others to the platform. This function should update the referralMapping mapping to associate the referrer's address with the address of the user they referred.

//Refer event would be emitted to log the referral and track the progress of the referral program.

//Finally, you should define the REFERRAL_REWARD_PERCENTAGE variable to specify the percentage of the transaction fee that is paid out as a referral reward.

//Overall, this contract would allow the ArbiTrade platform to implement a referral program that incentivizes users to invite their friends and colleagues to join the platform, while also providing a way to distribute rewards to those who help grow the platform's user base.
