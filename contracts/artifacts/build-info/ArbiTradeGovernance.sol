Sure, here's a sample implementation of the ArbiTrade Governance Contract:

//The ArbiTradeGovernance contract implements the following functions:

//submitProposal: This function allows users to submit proposals by providing a title, description, and voting period. A proposal requires a minimum of 1000 ArbiTrade tokens to be submitted.

//vote: This function allows users to vote on a proposal by indicating their support or opposition. Each token held by the voter represents one vote.

//executeProposal: This function allows the contract owner to execute a proposal once the voting period has ended and the votes have been counted. If the proposal receives more support than opposition, it is executed.

//getProposalCount: This function returns the total number of proposals submitted.

//onlyOwner: This modifier ensures that only the contract owner can access certain functions, such as executing proposals or withdrawing excess tokens from the contract.

//By implementing a governance contract, ArbiTrade enables token holders to participate in the decision-making process and vote on proposals that affect the future of the protocol. The requirement for ArbiTrade token holders to have a minimum balance of 1000 tokens in order to submit proposals ensures that proposals are submitted by users who have a stake in the success of the protocol. The ability to vote on proposals proportional to the number of tokens held enables token holders to have a meaningful say in the governance of the protocol.
