//The ArbiTradeToken contract implements the following functions:

//mint: This function allows the contract owner to mint new tokens with an annual inflation rate of 2%, as long as the total supply has not reached the maximum supply of 5 billion tokens.

//transfer: This function overrides the ERC20 transfer function and includes a revenue sharing feature, where 20% of transaction fees go to the contract owner's wallet as revenue.

//setRevenueShare: This function allows the contract owner to update the revenue sharing percentage, which cannot exceed 50%.

//onlyOwner: This modifier ensures that only the contract owner can access certain functions, such as minting new tokens or updating the revenue sharing percentage.

//By implementing a revenue sharing feature, the ArbiTrade Token Contract generates a sustainable revenue stream for the treasury, while also allowing the contract owner to adjust the revenue sharing percentage as needed. The inflation rate ensures that new tokens are minted over time to support the growth and adoption of the ArbiTrade ecosystem, while the maximum supply ensures that the token remains a scarce asset over the long term.
